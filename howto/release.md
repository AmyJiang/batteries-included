Make a release
--------------

# Quality checking

- `make test` on a 64 bits machine
- `make test` on a 32 bits machine

- install the to-be-released version with `opam pin add -k git .`, and
  then run the post-install tests with `make test-build-from-install`

  (If you do not want to provoke a rebuild of batteries-depending
  software in your main development switch, feel free to move to
  a fresh new switch to test this.)

- instead of the previous, you can also run the fully automatic
  'make test_install'

# Release marking

These steps can be redone as many times as necessary, and do not need
to be performed by someone with commit rights.

- inspect commits and sources to find @since tags to add/substitute
  (especially @since NEXT_RELEASE); `sh scripts/find_since.sh` can
  help

- check whether new functions should go in Incubator

- update the changelog with release notes

  The changelog should contain an entry for each notable change that
  went in the release, with proper crediting of contributors. You may
  want to use `git log` to check that nothing was forgotten.

  You should write a summary of the release in a few sentences, which
  will serve as release notes, and include it at the top of the
  Changelog for the new release.

- Bump version in source (in `_oasis`)

- change ocamlfind dependencies in `META` if necessary

- check that `make release` correctly produces a release tarball

# Performing the actual release

- Commit and add a tag (`git tag -a <name>`; `git push --tags origin`)
  Tag names are usually of the form "vM.m.b", for example "v2.5.3",
  use `git tag --list` to see existing tags.
- run `make release` to produce a tarball
- upload the tarball to ocamlforge
- upload the documentation (`make upload-docs` ?)
- send a pull-request against the public opam repository

# Post-release work

- create a Changelog section for NEXT_RELEASE
- once the new opam package is merged, announce on the mailing-list
